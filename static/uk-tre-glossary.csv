AI has advanced from rule-based systems to complex algorithms like deep learning. However, it lacks common sense, true understanding, and emotions, unlike human intelligence. Exaggerated expectations have led to misconceptions about AI's capabilities.
Potential pros of AI:
Efficiency: AI may automate tasks, boosting productivity.
Insights: AI may analyse data for better decision-making.
Personalisation: AI may tailor recommendations to individual preferences.
Healthcare: AI may aid in diagnosing medical conditions.
Language: AI could translate languages in real-time.
Automation: AI-driven robots may streamline industries.

Potential concerns about AI:
Bias: AI may perpetuate biases in its decisions.
Job Impact: Automation might lead to job displacement.
Privacy: AI's data use may raise privacy questions.
Ethics: AI decisions may raise ethical dilemmas.
Security: AI systems may be vulnerable to attacks.
Data Dependence: AI's accuracy might rely on quality data.

Example: Large-Language Models:
Large-language models like GPT-3 exemplify AI. They understand and generate human-like text. These models fall under Natural Language Processing (NLP), part of machine learning, where computers learn from data patterns.

Healthcare data is the information collected about a person's health and medical care. This information is collected as people see healthcare professionals, have tests and treatments as part of their care. It is stored in electronic health records (EHRs) used by the NHS. There are different types of healthcare data:

1. Simple Data: This data is organised in a table format and includes basic information like the patient's name, date of birth, gender, NHS number, and contact details. It also includes details about the patient's health, such as the reason for their visit, any illnesses or conditions they have, and the treatments or care they received. This data is entered by healthcare professionals or automatically generated, like appointment dates, diagnosis codes, test results, and prescribed medications. Patients may also provide additional information through questionnaires or surveys.

2. Free-Text Data: This refers to unstructured text information, like notes or letters, that healthcare professionals write or patients provide. It doesn't follow a specific format and may contain detailed descriptions or additional information about the patient's health.

3. Images: Healthcare data can also include images, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans. These images help healthcare professionals see and analyse specific body parts to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning.

4. Complex Data: This includes more advanced types of data, like genetic information obtained from gene sequences in DNA. Currently, genetic sequencing is not widely used in the NHS, but it may become more common in the future. This type of data can provide insights into a person's genetic makeup and potential health risks as well as form the basis of personalised treatments


All of this healthcare data is important for healthcare professionals to understand a patient's health history, make accurate diagnoses, and provide appropriate care and treatment.

The provider typically looks after things like physical security (preventing break-ins), electronic security (only permitting access by authorised users and preventing hacking over the network), and ‘resilience ‘(e.g. keeping regular backups, having devices for when one breaks, having batteries or generators for power cuts, and maybe having other data centres in case of disasters). Many cloud providers allow the customer to choose the physical location of the data centre (e.g. Cardiff versus California), which may be important for compliance with relevant data protection laws.

,Consent,Processes,"Consent is defined as individual providing freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of their wishes to provide their data for processing relating to him or her.
Consent within the context of data protection regulation is one of the grounds (lawful bases) for lawfully processing personal data in relation to an individual and is specific towards particlar activities.

Research consent is the process of documenting an individual's choice to be involved in a research project(s) and typically called informed consent - this conveys that there is a process to allow participants to make a meaningful choiceInformed consent"" is used to emphasise that understanding is crucial before agreeing, and typically applies when sharing personal data or participating in research studies. Research consent is commonly required for participation in clinical trials/research.

Broad consent is a mechanism of gaining the consent of an individual who donates their biosamples and health data with a view to their future use in research, and may not be specific to a particular research project at the time of collection.

Assent is the process of providing approval for data processing/involvement in research by an individual who is not legally eligible to do so (e.g. a child under the age of 16), and will be supported by an adult providing legal consent.

Unconsented research - although this is not necessarily a definition, it is a process by which other individuals (researchers or others) may obtain access to data for analytical purposes. This can be achieved through by different mechanisms: anonymisation/pseudonymisation (the removal of all patient identifiers) thereby rendering the dataset inidentifiable; alternatively by obtaining the specific approval by the Confidentiality Advisory Group, who approve the processing of healthcare data without explicit consent by individual(s) as an exemption to section 251 of the NHS Act 2006.

Withdrawal of consent is both a legal, and ethical right of the individual whose data is being processed, and must be respected in reference to data protection and research compliance. It allows an infividual to discontinue/rescind access to his/her data and prevent further processing.","Understanding how consent (or the lack of it) works for sharing healthcare data in the UK is essential. There are different rules depending on how easy it is to figure out who the data is about and where you are. In the UK, there's a rule that currently says you don't need to give informed consent if the data collected regularly is made fully anonymous. This means that your personal details are taken out, and no one can link the data back to you. However, it's a good question to ask whether all the data labeled as ""anonymous"" is truly untraceable. But, when it's about sharing personal healthcare data that can still identify you, it gets more complicated. The level of how easy it is to tell who you are and where you're located matters. Some places might want your agreement before they share your data, while others might not. It's important to note that the ""National Data Opt-Out"" is available in England. It lets you decide whether your data can be shared, even if you said yes before. This opt-out is like a way to say ""no"" to certain kinds of sharing. Remember, even though consent might not be explicitly requested in every situation, the choice not to ask for it is part of the current system.

Informed Consent and Choices:
Consent and informed consent are both about agreeing to something after understanding it fully. Regular ""consent"" involves knowing all the details and agreeing, just like when you give permission for the use of personal data in research after understanding the risks and benefits. ""Informed consent"" is a term we use when we want to emphasise that understanding is crucial before agreeing. In most cases, whether it's sharing personal data or participating in studies, consent should always be informed.

It's important to know that consent can change over time. People can decide to stop participating in research whenever they want, and this will not affect their healthcare treatment. This highlights how vital it is for researchers to keep talking with participants openly. This way, participants can freely decide what's best for them and feel like their choices matter.",DM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Informed consent here is an internationally agreed ethical principle of participatory research. “Informed” means that before deciding, the person should understand all relevant aspects of the study, including its aims and potential risks and benefits
Consent might not always be necessary in non-participatory epidemiological research that uses anonymised, routinely collected data. This kind of research doesn't require direct participation from people, as researchers work with data that has already been gathered. If it's ensured that nobody can be identified from the research, consent might not be needed. It's important to know that consent can change over time. People can decide to stop participating in research whenever they want, and they won't be treated badly for it. This highlights how vital it is for researchers to keep talking with participants openly. This way, participants can freely decide what's best for them and feel like their choices matter.",DM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AH,Public Benefit,Health Research,"Adapted from ADR UK & DM: 
Also known as ‘public good’, research or activity which is motivated by its benefit to society. This work often aims to provide evidence for public policies, services or decisions to ultimately improve lives.
Example: health data research to learn more about the causes, characteristics, or effects of a disease or condition, and how to best treat it, to improve health and care of patients and the public.
","When NHS data is used for research, the patients who participate in the research don't usually get immediate benefits from it. However, the research is done with the hope that it will benefit the general public and patients in the future. The main purpose of this research is to learn more about the causes, characteristics, or effects of a disease or condition, and how to best treat it. This knowledge can then be used to help others who may have similar health problems in the future.
Example might include:
Looking at who does and doesn’t get a particular condition, to discover what might put people at risk.
Studying people with a disease or condition in detail, to understand their problems or to develop new ideas about how to help them.
Conducting a trial of a new treatment with volunteers who have a particular condition, to see if it works.
Studying people who have had a certain treatment, to see how well it works or what side effects it has.

SL,Statistical Disclosure Control,Identifiability,The process of ensuring data such as analysis results that are being taken out of a TRE are properly anonymised to ensure no-one can figure out the identity of specific individuals.,"To ensure data is properly anonymised, the goal is to make sure that no one can figure out the identity of specific individuals from the data, even if they use clever mathematical techniques. One way to do this is by grouping information about people into larger groups that contain at least a certain number of people, like 10 individuals. If a group is smaller than this, it's usually reported as having ""less than 10 people"" instead of giving the exact number. Another approach is to combine small groups to make larger ones.
However, the threshold of 10 people is not a strict rule. Sometimes, even data about individuals might not reveal anyone's identity. For example, if you have a list of referral dates from a busy health service, each date corresponds to one person, but it may not disclose who those individuals are.
It's important to remember that while we've been talking about protecting people's identities in health research, the same idea can be applied to other situations, like safeguarding the identification of companies through the analysis of tax data.
